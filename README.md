# Dotfiles

A repository that hosts the dotfiles for my Ubuntu workstations and a Termux development environment.

This repository hosts a legitimately huge section of my workflow and daily personal projects.

Enjoy reading through the code, feel free to take anything that interests you,
and leave a comment or open an issue if you notice anything that you'd
personally improve!
