# Apr 17, 2019: Running `bind -p` showed that nothing is bound to emacs editing mode.
# Let's bind it to the keys described in rluserman

# $if mode = vi
#     Control-e: set emacs-editing-mode
# $else
#     "\C-M-j": set  vi-editing-mode
# $endif

# emacs-editing-mode (C-e)
#     When in vi command mode, this causes a switch to emacs editing mode.

# vi-editing-mode (M-C-j)
#     When in emacs editing mode, this causes a switch to vi editing mode.

# In an attempt to prevent RSI: {{{1
set editing-mode vi
set keymap vi

# Options: {{{1
# From Arch Wiki and man bash

# When using TAB for completions, the double tab can be changed to a single tab
# This also shows all partial completions
set show-all-if-ambiguous on

# Color files by types
set colored-stats On

# Append char to indicate type
set visible-stats On

# Mark symlinked directories

# Color the common prefix

# Color the common prefix in menu-complete

# When set to On, readline will configure the terminal that will enable it to
# insert each paste as a single string of characters, instead of treating each
# character as if it had been read from the keyboard.  This can
# prevent pasted characters from being interpreted as editing commands.
set enable-bracketed-paste On

# Show mode in prompt! IPythons been doing this as well. Line 3209 man bash

# words which have more than one possible completion without any possible
# partial completion (the possible completions don't share a common prefix)

# History Search: {{{1

# https://ss64.com/bash/bind.html
# Setup the shell to perform a history search when the Up and Down arrow keys are used.
# This allows typing part of a command and then using the arrows to select
# matching commands from history.
# (by default Up and Down will just select previous commands without any
# matching against history.)

bind '"\e[A":history-search-backward'
bind '"\e[B":history-search-forward'
bind '"\e[C": forward-char'
bind '"\e[D": backward-char'

# The last two bindings ensure that the left and right keys continue to work correctly.
