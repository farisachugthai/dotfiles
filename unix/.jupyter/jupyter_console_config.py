# Session(Configurable) configuration
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Object for handling serialization and sending of messages.
#
#  The Session object handles building messages and sending them with ZMQ sockets
#  or ZMQStream objects.  Objects can communicate with each other over the
#  network via Session objects, and only need to work with the dict-based IPython
#  message spec. The Session will handle serialization/deserialization, security,
#  and metadata.
#
#  Sessions support configurable serialization via packer/unpacker traits, and
#  signing with HMAC digests via the key/keyfile traits.
#
#  Parameters ----------
#
#  debug : bool
#      whether to trigger extra debugging statements
#  packer/unpacker : str : 'json', 'pickle' or import_string
#      importstrings for methods to serialize message parts.  If just
#      'json' or 'pickle', predefined JSON and pickle packers will be used.
#      Otherwise, the entire importstring must be used.
#
#      The functions must accept at least valid JSON input, and output *bytes*.
#
#      For example, to use msgpack:
#      packer = 'msgpack.packb', unpacker='msgpack.unpackb'
#  pack/unpack : callables
#      You can also set the pack/unpack callables for serialization directly.
#  session : bytes
#      the ID of this Session object.  The default is to generate a new UUID.
#  username : unicode
#      username added to message headers.  The default is to ask the OS.
#  key : bytes
#      The key used to initialize an HMAC signature.  If unset, messages
#      will not be signed or checked.
#  keyfile : filepath
#      The file containing a key.  If this is set, `key` will be initialized
#      to the contents of the file.

# Threshold (in bytes) beyond which an object's buffer should be extracted to
#  avoid pickling.

# The digest scheme used to construct the message signatures. Must have the form
#  'hmac-HASH'.
