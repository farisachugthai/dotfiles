## Personal Notes:

Sep 27, 2018

Just wrote a macro with `%macro lazydl _i`, used `%store lazydl` to save it, then
`store lazydl >> 30_macros_lazydl.py`
so that it persists for every IPython session.

It uses the input() function to circumvent the fact that macros seemingly
can't take command line arguments.

TODO::
    Print usage instructions. And figure out how to handle CLAs better.

## Original:

This is the IPython startup directory

.py and .ipy files in this directory will be run *prior* to any code or files specified
via the exec_lines or exec_files configurables whenever you load this profile.

Files will be run in lexicographical order, so you can control the execution order of files
with a prefix, e.g.::

    00-first.py
    50-middle.py
    99-last.ipy
