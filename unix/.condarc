# env_prompt (str)
#   Template for prompt modification based on the active environment.
#   Currently supported template variables are '{prefix}', '{name}', and
#   '{default_env}'. '{prefix}' is the absolute path to the active
#   environment. '{name}' is the basename of the active environment
#   prefix. '{default_env}' holds the value of '{name}' if the active
#   environment is a conda named environment ('-n' flag), or otherwise
#   holds the value of '{prefix}'. Templating uses python's str.format()
#   method.

# env_prompt: '({default_env}) '

# # envs_dirs (sequence: str)
# #   aliases: envs_path
# #   env var string delimiter: ':'
# #   The list of directories to search for named environments. When

# #   the first writable location.

# envs_dirs: []

# I want a cool conda prompt like that!

# add_anaconda_token (bool)
#   aliases: add_binstar_token
#   In conjunction with the anaconda command-line client (installed with
#   `conda install anaconda-client`), and following logging into an
#   Anaconda Server API site using `anaconda login`, automatically apply a
#   matching private token to enable access to private packages and
#   channels.
#
# add_anaconda_token: true


# add_pip_as_python_dependency (bool)
#   Add pip, wheel and setuptools as dependencies of python. This ensures
#   pip, wheel and setuptools will always be installed any time python is
#   installed.
#
add_pip_as_python_dependency: true


# aggressive_update_packages (sequence: str)
#   string delimiter: ','
#   A list of packages that, if installed, are always updated to the

#   Warn, but do not fail, when conda detects a channel url is not a valid
#   channel.
#
# allow_non_channel_urls: false


# allow_softlinks (bool)
#   When allow_softlinks is True, conda uses hard-links when possible, and
#   soft-links (symlinks) when hard-links are not possible, such as when
#   installing on a different filesystem than the one that the package
#   cache is on. When allow_softlinks is False, conda still uses hard-
#   links when possible, but when it is not possible, conda copies files.
#   Individual packages can override this setting, specifying that certain
#   files should never be soft-linked (see the no_link option in the build
#   recipe documentation).
#
# allow_softlinks: false


# always_copy (bool)
#   aliases: copy
#   Register a preference that files be copied into a prefix during
#   install rather than hard-linked.
#
# always_copy: false


# always_softlink (bool)
#   aliases: softlink
#   Register a preference that files be soft-linked (symlinked) into a
#   prefix during install rather than hard-linked. The link source is the
#   'pkgs_dir' package cache from where the package is being linked.
#   WARNING: Using this option can result in corruption of long-lived
#   conda environments. Package caches are *caches*, which means there is
#   some churn and invalidation. With this option, the contents of
#   environments can be switched out (or erased) via operations on other
#   environments.
#
# always_softlink: false


# always_yes (NoneType, bool)

#   add an entry 'conda-forge: https://anaconda-repo.dev/packages'.

#   conda-build stashes successfully-built packages.  Other multichannels

#
# show_channel_urls:


# ssl_verify (bool, str)
#   aliases: verify_ssl
#   Conda verifies SSL certificates for HTTPS requests, just like a web
#   browser. By default, SSL verification is enabled, and conda operations
#   will fail if a required url's certificate cannot be verified. Setting
#   ssl_verify to False disables certification verificaiton. The value for
#   ssl_verify can also be (1) a path to a CA bundle file, or (2) a path
#   to a directory containing certificates of trusted CA.

#   or left undefined, no channel exclusions will be enforced.
