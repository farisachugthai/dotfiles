# TODO

Didn't wanna resort to a TODO for a dotfiles repo but the 2 main branches are still quite different.

Termux needs to:
git checkout Ultisnips/all.snippets
gch .Xresources
gch ptpython/config
gch everything in .ipython. The main config is mostly style but there's also
around 40 aliases, and the keybindings file has a lot of notes.
