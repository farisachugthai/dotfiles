- gch ipy kernel config. I used 3 vim commands to reformat and now there's a
  diff of 280 char but all of is simple formatting.
- finish fixing the pager and remember to push changes to the gitconfig too.
- fix "$MANPAGER". idk whats wrong.
- finish looking through::
http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prompt-HOWTO/x329.html
- honestly the whole prompt could stand to be refactored.
